Task #2 â€“ 0/1 Knapsack Problem                                                  (65 Points)

Use the Best-First  search with Branch-and-Bound algorithm to solve 0/1 knapsack problem.

INPUT:
    Positive integer W (knapsack capacity) and an input.txt file that contains the weights
    and profits of n objects. (The first line of this file should contain profits and the
    second line should include respective weights of n objects; use colon or space to
    separate values.)

OUTPUT:
    Visited node, profit, weight, bound, maximum profit and updated Priority queue at each step.
    An integer maximum profit that is the sum of the profits of an optimal set and objects of
    that optimal set.

Note: you can use the example explained in the class as your reference.
