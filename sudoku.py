Task #1 â€“ Sudoku Puzzle Solver                                                                         (35 Points)

Problem Description:
Sudoku is a number-placement problem in which a partially filled 9x9 grid is filled with digits
from 1 to 9. The 9x9 grid itself consists of 9 sub-girds of size 3x3. The objective of this
puzzle is to assign single digits from 1 to 9 in empty cells of this grid such that every row,
every column and every sub-gird contains exactly one instance of the numbers between1 to 9.

Use backtracking technique to solve a given Sudoku Puzzle.

INPUT:

    Your program must read from an input.txt file which contains a partially filled 9x9 gird
    of numbers. (To represent empty cells use 0 or -1).

OUTPUT: 

    Print the solved puzzle in format of a 9x9 grid.
